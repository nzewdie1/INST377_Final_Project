# Weather-Based Trip Planner

## 🌍 Project Overview

This is a web-based application that helps users plan trips based on three key factors: **location**, **date**, and **weather preference**. Users can choose to input one, two, or all three factors, and the system will provide destination recommendations that match the selected weather preferences. The app uses the [Open-Meteo API](https://open-meteo.com/) for live weather forecasts and supports both single-city queries and multi-day, multi-location recommendations filtered by continent and weather type.
